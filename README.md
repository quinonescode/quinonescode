# Tatiana Quiñones
**Behavioral Data Scientist | Predictive Analytics & Financial Operations**

##  Bio
I am a **Behavioral Data Scientist** specializing in the intersection of human psychology and quantitative modeling. My work focuses on transforming high-frequency behavioral data—from financial transactions to safety telemetry—into actionable insights. With a background in **I/O Psychology** and an **MBA in Predictive Analytics**, I bridge the gap between "what" the data says and "why" humans behave the way they do.

I am currently leveraging the **R and Python** ecosystems to solve complex problems in **Causal Inference**, **Risk Detection**, and **Product Optimization**.

##  Selected Projects

###  [Predictive Risk & Retention Engine](https://github.com/quinonescode/Retention-Modeling) 
* **The Goal:** Identifying behavioral "red flags" to proactively mitigate customer churn in institutional settings.
* **The Impact:** Engineered a Random Forest model for 10K+ records, utilizing stratified sampling to identify "at-risk" individuals with a 12% improvement in prediction accuracy.
* **Domain:** Behavioral Risk / Retention Analytics.

###  [Causal Inference: Policy Impact Analysis](https://github.com/quinonescode/Causal-Analysis)
* **The Goal:** Isolating the true effect of systemic interventions in complex, noisy environments.
* **The Impact:** Applied Propensity Score Matching to evaluate "Safety Interventions" in high-frequency telemetry data, stripping away confounding variables to measure pure ROI.
* **Domain:** Experimental Design / Causal ML.

###  [Financial Transaction Forensic Pipeline](https://github.com/quinonescode/Fintech-Forensics)
* **The Goal:** Detecting anomalies and optimizing cost structures in high-volume payment data streams.
* **The Impact:** Developed automated SQL/Python scripts to reconcile tiered fee structures and identify processing outliers, mimicking exchange-fee reconciliation processes.
* **Domain:** Financial Operations / Data Integrity.
